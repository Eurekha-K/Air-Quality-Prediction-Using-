# Air-Quality-Prediction-Using-
This repository houses a Python-based project focused on predicting air quality using the Facebook Prophet time series forecasting library. The model leverages historical air quality data and meteorological factors to forecast pollutant levels.

# Understanding Prophet
Facebook Prophet is an open-source time series forecasting library designed for handling time series data with complex seasonal patterns and multiple trend changes. It's particularly useful for air quality prediction due to the inherent seasonal and trend components in air pollution data.

# Data Preparation
Data Collection: Gather historical air quality data, including pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.

Feature Engineering: Create additional features if necessary, such as time-based features (hour, day of week, month), or derived variables (e.g., temperature differences).

Data Formatting: Structure the data into a Pandas DataFrame with a 'ds' column for dates and a 'y' column for the target variable (e.g., PM2.5).

# Building the Prophet Model

Import Prophet: Import the Prophet library from the fbprophet package.

Instantiate the Model: Create a Prophet object, specifying any necessary parameters (e.g., growth, seasonality, holidays).

Fit the Model: Fit the Prophet model to the prepared data.

Make Predictions: Use the fitted model to generate future predictions.

# Incorporating External Regressors

Prophet allows for the inclusion of external regressors to improve prediction accuracy. Consider adding relevant features like:

Meteorological data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

Calendar events: Holidays, weekends, or special events.

Pollution sources: Data on industrial emissions or traffic volume.

# Evaluating the Model

Performance Metrics: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate the model's accuracy. Â  

Visualization: Plot the predicted values against actual values to visually assess the model's performance.
